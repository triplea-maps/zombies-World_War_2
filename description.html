						<br>Based upon Axis & Allies & Zombies
						<br>Player nations are not allowed to invade neutrals, but can move in once zombies have taken over.
						<br>Note that in this weIrd alternate history scenario, the Zombies are restless dead (Draugr) and not contagious as in most modern zombie fiction. They are capable of using weaponry, but too impaired to handle sophisticated weaponry or coordinate their actions.
						<br>The dead were awakened uncontrallably by Nazi occultists
						<br>The big change from the original game is that Zombies are not spawned by killing infantry, as there was no way to handle that in TripleA. Instead every area has 1% chance per turn of spawning a horde of 10. In addition each area has a 10% chance each turn of spawning 1.
